# The Ashen Chronicle

## Roadmap

The roadmap tracks current and upcoming development. Detailed completed milestone history is kept in [`docs/roadmap-history.md`](docs/roadmap-history.md). The intended product direction is recorded in [`docs/design-principles.md`](docs/design-principles.md); this roadmap distinguishes those long-term goals from what is currently implemented and validated.

## Current state

**v0.51.23 — release complete.** Android text-input and graphical gameplay stabilization are complete. The developer console has explicit input ownership and a Close control.

**v0.52.x — location banner prototype complete.** Ashen Gate uses a full-width pixel-art PNG banner with nearest-neighbor sampling; other locations and banner-load failures retain the ASCII fallback.

## Active milestone

**v0.52.x — Procedural spatial exploration prototype** ([tracking issue #353](https://github.com/right-ward/ashen_chronicle/issues/353))

The first implementation slice is tracked in [#354 — spatial state and deterministic local-map generation](https://github.com/right-ward/ashen_chronicle/issues/354), [#355 — continuous movement and discovery](https://github.com/right-ward/ashen_chronicle/issues/355), and [#356 — exploration persistence and inheritance](https://github.com/right-ward/ashen_chronicle/issues/356).

The renderer-neutral map model and deterministic generator are in place, alongside the Bevy exploration view for dangerous locations, continuous keyboard/touch movement with blocked-terrain collision, angled tile projection, and depth ordering. Flat floor, ash, and rubble tiles now use a background layer so they cannot cover the player. Player depth follows continuous ground position, and wall tops/faces use their ground-contact lines for occlusion ordering. The view includes a contextual point-of-interest interaction recorded in world history. World-persistent local maps live in the saved world state; exact active exploration position/session live with the character. The viewport-scaled camera dead zone and bounds for wall geometry are implemented. Physical edge passages are derived from connected world-location IDs and require proximity/clear approach; until all connected destinations have spatial maps, using a passage returns to normal gameplay just like `Leave`. First-pass pixel-art tiles now distinguish wood flooring, ash, rubble, and wall tops, with a character sprite and passage marker. Spatial UI icons now use named PNG assets loaded at runtime from the selected `data/assets/icons/ui/` folder. The same asset loader accepts mod-owned images under `data/mods/<folder>/assets/`; missing icons are logged and omitted rather than rendered as Unicode or white-glyph placeholders. Basic deterministic pillar/table prop collision and occlusion are now part of the prototype. Old Shrine content selects a first authored chamber template with intersecting walls, a doorway, a pillar, and a table ([tracking issue #381](https://github.com/right-ward/ashen_chronicle/issues/381)); its geometry is generated only for new local maps and then persists with the map. Arbitrary room graphs, additional authored templates, full room/door topology, and room-aware camera transitions remain future work. Desktop/Android end-to-end validation remains outstanding and is intentionally left to the repository owner. Spatial controls expose eight-way directional input for diagonal movement, UI scroll panels consume desktop mouse-wheel input as well as touch drags, button actions activate on completed clicks, and touch-scroll gestures suppress activation of the button they began on. Spatial exploration uses an Android-only analog virtual joystick with a dead zone and pressure-scaled movement; desktop movement is keyboard-driven with no on-screen directional pad. Spatial exploration now also has a compact persistent vitals panel showing character identity/level, current/max health, and active conditions, using the shared health-gauge primitive. A targeted wall-top depth-tie correction ensures the player wins equal-depth ordering; device/manual playtesting remains pending, and full room/prop occlusion is still future work.

Keep the existing world model, quests, time, narrative, and location-level actions authoritative. Spatial exploration supplements rather than replaces them. Real-time spatial combat and audio remain outside this milestone.

Related design issues: [#228 — long-term hybrid exploration](https://github.com/right-ward/ashen_chronicle/issues/228), [#229 — incremental pixel-art direction](https://github.com/right-ward/ashen_chronicle/issues/229), and [#252 — spatial combat design](https://github.com/right-ward/ashen_chronicle/issues/252).

## Longer-term direction

Continue modularizing the codebase by responsibility rather than by file size alone. Keep runtime state, content loading, gameplay actions, presentation, persistence, and event processing independently understandable and testable.

The product direction is a character-focused, graphics-first spatial RPG backed by a persistent simulation. Spatial exploration is being delivered incrementally; real-time spatial action combat and audio integration remain future work, not current milestone claims. Keep world systems character-centred rather than turning them into remote grand-strategy management. Desktop and mobile support, hybrid input, scalable visual/simulation quality, offline single-player, player-controlled updates, and robust save/mod compatibility remain guiding constraints. See the [design principles](docs/design-principles.md).

Major gameplay work should remain data-driven where practical, preserve backward compatibility, and include focused tests for behavior affected by the change.
